 Waste Classification Project

This project is designed to classify waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories. By leveraging machine learning, the model helps in recognizing different types of waste and can be used to support sustainable waste management efforts.

## 1. Overview
The project involves training a machine learning model to classify waste images. Given an image, the model predicts whether the waste belongs to the "biodegradable" or "non-biodegradable" category. This setup is useful for recycling and waste sorting applications, helping automate the process of waste classification.

## 2. Project Structure
The project includes the following key files:
- **originalpredict.py**: Contains the original prediction logic. This file may be used to explore or verify the prediction process.
- **predictwithmodel.py**: This script is tailored for loading the trained waste classifier model (`waste_classifier_model.pkl`) and generating predictions based on input images.
- **waste_classifier_model.pkl**: The serialized (pre-trained) waste classification model saved in a .pkl format, which can be loaded for inference.

## 3. Requirements
To ensure compatibility, install the following libraries:
- **Python 3.x**: The project requires Python 3. Ensure it’s installed and updated.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn`: For model training and data processing.
  - `opencv-python`: For image processing and handling.
  - `joblib`: For saving and loading the trained model.
- You can install all required libraries in one step using the `requirements.txt` file.

## 4. Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and clone the repository using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
     cd your-repository-name
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required libraries by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   This command installs all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, ensuring the project environment is ready for use.

## 5. Usage
After setting up the environment, follow these steps to run the model and make predictions.

1. **Run the Prediction Script**:
   - The main prediction script (`predictwithmodel.py`) loads the model and runs it on specified input data. Execute it using:
     ```bash
     python predictwithmodel.py
     ```

2. **Customizing Input Data**:
   - By default, `predictwithmodel.py` might be configured to look for test images in a certain directory. Adjust the code to point to your image directory, or modify the image file paths directly in the script.

## 6. Files
Each file in the repository has a specific role:

- **originalpredict.py**: This script contains the base logic for predictions and may include initial testing functions.
- **predictwithmodel.py**: The main script that loads `waste_classifier_model.pkl` and performs predictions on input images.
- **waste_classifier_model.pkl**: The pre-trained machine learning model that’s loaded by `predictwithmodel.py` for waste classification.

## 7. Model Training (If Needed)
If you want to retrain the model:
   - Organize your dataset in a similar folder structure as the one used here.
   - Use any training script or tools compatible with this model type to re-train and save your model.
