scikit-learn:

Purpose: Scikit-learn is a robust library for machine learning in Python. It includes a range of algorithms and tools for model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.
In Our Project: Scikit-learn is used to:
Train and use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which classifies images based on features.
Split data into training and test sets for evaluation.
Calculate model accuracy and generate a classification report.

numpy:

Purpose: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It allows for efficient array operations and mathematical calculations, which are essential for image and feature data manipulation.
In Our Project: NumPy is used to:
Store images and features in arrays.
Perform fast numerical operations on images (like reshaping or stacking arrays).
Handle data formatting for the machine learning model.
